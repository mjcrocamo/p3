## 3 Unique inputs
+ I had a text input for the user's first name and last name. The first letter of these names is used to help generate their pirate name 
+ I had a radio button for the user to submit their birthday month.
+ I had a checkbox that when checked, it reversed the pirate name that was output to the page.

## Packages
barryvdh/laravel-debugbar

## Code style divergences
+ None

## Notes for instructor
+ The only bug I noticed was that I couldn't figure out how to have the chosen month (radio button) left checked off when a validation error occured on form submission. I used the old keyword with every other input and it worked as planned but I was unsure how to do this with the month buttons.
